Ah, it sounds like you're talking about seeing the check mark/tick icons (or status icons like green check, red cross, blue dot, etc.) in File Explorer for your Git-tracked folders/files â€” a feature often referred to as "Git status overlay icons".

These tick icons show the version control status of files (e.g., committed, modified, staged) and are typically provided by Git GUI tools like TortoiseGit, GitHub Desktop, or Sourcetree.
